# Time_series_analysis_gun_and_death

The monthly handgun sales and firearms related deaths data (GD data) in California is the monthly observations at 227 times point in 1980-1998. The project studys the relationship and seasonal compnents between Gun and Death data.

Time series analysis for two veriables and the correlations between them result is shown below.
